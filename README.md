Sacred texts w.r.t. Radha Soami Faith

Radha Soami Faith stands as a Meditation-based Faith which necessitates Living Master's internal as well as external presence along with Soul calming down nervous system and taking back Soul to it's Origin ultimately. Radha Soami Spiritual Science was founded by HH Huzur Soami Ji Maharaj aka Seth Shiv Dayal Singh Ji on 15th February 1861 on request of His ardent Pupil HH Huzur Maharaj aka Rai Bahadur Saligram Ji and other pupils too. Later, two more sincere and ardent Pupils, viz. Baba Jaimal Singh Ji Maharaj and Baba Gharib Das Ji Maharaj aka Narayan Das Ji orchestrated this science in and near regions near Beas, Punjab and Delhi respectively.

As of today, Radha Soami Satsang Beas, sincerely founded by Charan Singh Ji Maharaj, has more than 5k+ Indian decentralized spiritual science initiation nodes and 90+ International nodes.

All Names, viz. Radha Soami, Radha Swami, Radhaswami, Radhasoami etc. convey the same spiritual science with few prerequisites as follows:
  1. Practitioners must abstain from non-vegetarian diet.
  2. They must abstain from alcohol consumption.
  3. They must abstain from extramarital affairs.
  4. They must dedicate few hours of day in practice taught by The Living Master.

These Sacred texts will guide you to love The Living Master and ardently follow the spiritual science as mentioned in them as the real work of spiritual devotion aka meditation will begin the moment The Living Master bestows upon you His mercy.
